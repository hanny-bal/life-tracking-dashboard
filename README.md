# Life tracking dashboard
This repository contains code for a life tracking dashboard that brings together time entries from Toggl Track, user surveys with Google Forms and auxiliary data sources. The software is a template for similar efforts and should serve as a replacement for visualisation tools like Looker Studio or Power BI, which are often used for this purpose.
